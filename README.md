# AI_Programming_with_Python
This repository contains my submissions for Udacity's nanodegree program 'AI Programming with Python'. 

## Intro to AI for Python Programmers
**First Project: Use Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds**

The first project deals with using a given pre-trained image classifier in order to identify dog breeds and demonstrating the necessary Python skills for setting up a machine learning project.

*Please note that the foundation of the code was provided by Udacity as a starting point for the project.

## Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Focus on library packages for Python for data wrangling, data analysis for large data, and data visualization.

## Linear Algebra Essentials

Learn the basics of Linear Algebra and why it is an important tool in the world of AI.

## Calculus Essentials

Learn foundational topics in calculus to understand how to train a neural network.

## Neural Networks - AI Programming with Python

Learn concepts and how to apply concepts to design neural networks and algorithms to solve particular problems.

## Create Your Own Image Classifier

**For the final project, we will build a state-of-the-art image classification application.
