# AI_Programming_with_Python
This repository contains my practice and submissions for Udacity's nanodegree program 'AI Programming with Python'. 

## Intro to AI for Python Programmers
[First Project: Use Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds](https://github.com/njeanette03/AI_Programming_with_Python/tree/main/Udacity_first%20project_Use%20Pre-trained%20Image%20Classifier) 

The first project deals with using a given pre-trained image classifier in order to identify dog breeds and demonstrating the necessary Python skills for setting up a machine learning project.

*Please note that the foundation of the code was provided by Udacity as a starting point for the project.

## NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Focus on library packages for Python for data wrangling, data analysis for large data, and data visualization.

* [NumPy Mini-Project](https://github.com/njeanette03/AI_Programming_with_Python/blob/main/NumPy%20Mini-Project/Mean%20Normalization%20and%20Data%20Separation.ipynb) Mean normalize and separate data
* [Pandas Mini-Project](https://github.com/njeanette03/AI_Programming_with_Python/blob/main/Pandas%20Mini-Project/Statistics%20from%20Stock%20Data.ipynb) Get statistics from stock data

## Linear Algebra Essentials

Learn the basics of Linear Algebra and why it is an important tool in the world of AI.

## Calculus Essentials

Learn foundational topics in calculus to understand how to train a neural network.

## Neural Networks - AI Programming with Python

Learn concepts and how to apply concepts to design neural networks and algorithms to solve particular problems.

## Create Your Own Image Classifier

**For my final project for the AI programming in Python nanodegree at Udacity, I built and trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers on a Flower Dataset and then predicted new flower images. The Dataset contains 102 flower categories.

I developed the code in Python for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then converted into a command line applications: train.py, predict.py. The code is first implement in a Jupyter notebook.
